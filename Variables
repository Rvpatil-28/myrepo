VARIABLE-
        Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value. 

# Variable 'x' stores the integer value 10
x = 5

# Variable 'name' stores the string "Samantha"
name = "Samantha"  

print(x)                          // 5
print(name)                       // Samantha
