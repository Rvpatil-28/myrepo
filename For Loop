Python For Loops are used for iterating over a sequence like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.

For loop allows you to apply the same operation to every item within loop.
Using For Loop avoid the need of manually managing the index.
For loop can iterate over any iterable object, such as dictionary, list or any custom iterators.

s = ["Geeks", "for", "Geeks"]
# using for loop with string
for i in s:
    print(i)

for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
