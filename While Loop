Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
When the condition becomes false,the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

# Python example for while loop
count = 0
while (count < 3):
    count = count + 1
    print("Hello Geek")

# An empty loop
a = 'geeksforgeeks'
i = 0

while i < len(a):
    i += 1
    pass

print('Value of i :', i)
